# Python Tutorial

### Welcome to the Python Tutorial. This Tutorial covers three basic topics within Data Structures:
- [Stacks](1-Stack.md)
- [Sets](2-Set.md)
- [Trees](3-Tree.md)

 Each topic covered will have a real world example, possible circumstances for use, coding example, big O notation, and finally a solveable problem to participate in. The solution will be given, but please refrain from looking at it until you've attempted solving the problem.
