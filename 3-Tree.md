# **Tree**

## **Examples**
Out of all three types of Data Structures, Trees are the most complicated.

Trees are a way to have organized nodes of data. This data can range from integers being sorted in the tree to a node holding a hash key from a library or anything else you want to organize. Think of it like a special linked list. Instead of the pointers connecting through one direct line there are a few branches because of the differing values between nodes.

You can think of a family tree for this. You have 2 parents who each also have 2 parents. You have 4 granparents but 2 of those are specifically from your dad and 2 from your mom. Each set of grandparents need to be organized so you can see who's more closely related to who.
